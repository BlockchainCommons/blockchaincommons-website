**Repo:** [Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line)<br>
**Status:** v2.0 Complete (2020-10-20)

This is a complete nineteen-chapter course intended to teach system administrators, developers, and engineers who are already acquainted with the UNIX command line interface how to work with Bitcoin. It uses this methodology to teach the fundamentals of Bitcoin, from RPC communications to how transactions work and how scripts work. The majority of the course is focused on `bitcoin-cli`, but there's also information on scripting, on programming with the RPC interface, and on using other command-line programs, beginning with `lightning-cli`.

**PDF:** [#SC v1.01](https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101)
**Repo:** [SmartCustodyBook](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook)<br>
**Status:** v1.01 Complete (2019-09-16)

_The Use of Advanced Cryptographic Tools to Improve the Care, Maintenance, Control, and Protection of Digital Assets._ This five-chapter (186-page) book is intended to make you rethink the security of your digital assets. It puts together a risk-modeling system with two additional building blocks: a cold-storage scenario for managing self-custody; and an extensively detailed list of potential adversaries. By working through the book, you can determine which adversaries are actually the most dangerous to your assets, and adjust your own self-custody scenario to accomodate them. Additional chapters talk about fiduciary duties with regard to digital assets. 

A v2.0 of this book is in the planning stage, to improve the accessibility of the course, to support additional hardware tools, and to introduce multi-signature scenarios.
