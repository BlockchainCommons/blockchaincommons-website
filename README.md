Blockchain Commons is proudly a "not-for-profit" social benefit corporation committed to open source & open development. Our goal is ti support blockchain infrastructure and the broader security industry through cryptographic research, cryptographic & privacy protocol implementations, architecture & code reviews, industry standards, and documentation. In particular, we seek to improve the blockchain ecosystem by focusing on infrastructure and solutions that are decentralized, platform-neutral, blockchain-neutral, and vendor-independent.

Our current projects include:

* [#SmartCustody](https://www.smartcustody.com/) — documents and tools to better secure your digital assets.
* [#BitcoinStandup](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup) — tools and standards for easy creation of your own Bitcoin-Core full node on your Mac or Linux or on a cloud VPS.
* [#FullyNoded2](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2) — an iOS multisig wallet powered by a Tor V3 hidden service and connected to your own personal full node.
* [#LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) — DIY hardware box and SDK for airgapped cryptography and offline master key management.
* [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) — tutorials on programming with bitcoin-cli, lightning-cli, and RPC.
* Cryptographic Libraries — C-based implementations of [BIP39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [Shamir Secret Sharing](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [SLIP39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), and more.

We also offer services to improve the open web's security infrastructure:

* Security Reviews — risk-based assessments of custody methodologies, operational security procedures, and layer-2 protocols such as payment channels.
* Infrastructure — support of Tor exit nodes and other blockchain infrastructure & tools.
* Project Support — contractual support of our projects such as #BitcoinStandup, #FullyNoded2, and #LetheKit.

These are just the beginning! Blockchain Commons is also working on identity wallets, zero-knowledge curve-operation proofs, advanced cryptographic primitives such as Schnorr, MuSig, and scriptless scripts, and in general establishing multi- and cross-blockchain standards.
