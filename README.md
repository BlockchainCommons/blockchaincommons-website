Blockchain Commons is proudly a "not-for-profit" social benefit corporation committed to open infrastructure.  Our goal to create low-cost, best-quality, proven infrastructure that is decentralized, platform-neutral, blockchain-neutral, and vendor-independent. Anyone can use or improve our tools, and no one can take away, allowing companies and individuals to bring complete solutions to market while staying focused on what makes their own business or project unique.

Our current projects include:

* [Gordian Products & Technologies](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) — integrated wallet and node technology that creates a self-sovereign infrastructure for Bitcoin  using Tor and QuickConnect.
* [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) — tutorials on programming with bitcoin-cli, lightning-cli, and RPC.
* [#SmartCustody](https://www.smartcustody.com/) — documents and tools to better secure your digital assets.
* [#LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) — DIY hardware box and SDK for airgapped cryptography and offline master-key management.
* [#Seedtool-cli](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli) — cross-platform command-line C-based implementation for safe master key generation with support of BIP39 and SLIP39.
* [Spotbit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit) — self-sovereign cryptocurrency price discovery tool.
* Cryptographic Libraries — C-based implementations of [BIP39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [Shamir Secret Sharing](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [SLIP39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), and more.

We also offer services to the community improve the security of the web's open infrastructure.

* Security Reviews — risk-based assessments of custody methodologies, operational security procedures, and layer-2 protocols such as payment channels.
* Infrastructure — support of Tor exit nodes and other blockchain infrastructure & software.
* Project Support — contractual support of our open source projects such as GordianWallet-iOS, GordianServer-MacOS, and #LetheKit.

These are just the beginning! Blockchain Commons is also working on other cryptographic research, cryptographic & privacy protocol implementations, architecture & code reviews, industry standards, and documentation, including identity wallets, social-recovery techniques, zero-knowledge curve-operation proofs, advanced cryptographic primitives such as Schnorr, MuSig, and scriptless scripts, and in general establishing multi- and cross-blockchain standards.
