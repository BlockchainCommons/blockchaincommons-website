Blockchain Commons was founded with the goal of supporting blockchain infrastructure and the broader security industry through cryptographic research, cryptographic & privacy protocol implementations, architecture & code reviews, industry standards, etc. In particular, we seek to improve the blockchain ecosystem by focusing on infrastructure and solutions that are decentralized, platform & blockchain neutral and vendor-independent. Blockchain Commons is a "not-for-profit" benefit corporation, with a strong commitment to open source and a defensive patent strategy.

Projects in process include: supporting best-practices and standards for digital asset custody known as [#SmartCustody](https://www.SmartCustody.com), human rights decentralized identity [#RebootingWebOfTrust](https://www.WebOfTrust.info), developing an open source identity wallet reference implementation; expanding social key-recovery techniques; creating new zero-knowledge curve-operation proofs;  security review of sidechain pegging and merge mining; supporting cross-chain atomic transfers; and establishing multi- and cross-blockchain standards.
