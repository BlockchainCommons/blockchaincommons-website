Blockchain Commons was founding with the goal of supporting blockchain infrastructure and the broader security industry with research, cryptographic & privacy protocol implementations, architecture & code reviews, etc. In particular, we are focused on infrastructure and solutions that are decentralized, platform & blockchain neutral and vendor-independent. We want to improve the blockchain ecosystem. Blockchain Commons is a "not-for-profit" benefit corporation, with a strong commitment to open source and a defensive patent strategy.

Projects in process include: supporting best-practices and standards for digital asset custody known as [#SmartCustody](https://www.SmartCustody.com), developing an open source identity wallet reference implementation; expanding social key-recovery techniques; creating new zero-knowledge curve-operation proofs;  security review of sidechain pegging and merge mining; supporting cross-chain atomic transfers; and establishing multi- and cross-blockchain standards.
