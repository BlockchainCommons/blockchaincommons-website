# Sustaining Sponsors

## Why Sponsor?

BLockchain Commons' mission is to support open blockchain infrastructure and the broader security industry. We are proudly a "not-for-profit" social benefit corporation committed to open source & open development. 

Our mission is funded entirely by donations and collaborative partnerships with people like you. Every contribution will be spent on building open tools, technologies, and techniques that sustain and advance blockchain and internet security infrastructure and promote an open web.

**[Bitmark](https://bitmark.com/) was founded in 2014 to fix and restore trust in the Internet. They wanted to show the world that being able to trust data would lead to a better future for all. Today, Bitmark builds not only the protocol to restore trust in data but also consumer apps that empower humans in the digital age. Bitmark believes the faster the world moves to an Internet where data can be trusted, the better.
